project: enrollment system
This project creates a system for the admin to help students to enroll or cancel enrollment.

The system can rewrite students' names and gender, enroll and cancel enrollment, and inquiry information about students and courses.  

The purpose of the practice is to understand how to manipulate JSON files, e.g., read and write.

Conclusion:
The program will read all data at the beginning. It will waste time and memory if the student data is not the target to change. 
So, it would be good to save student data separately and read it only if the users ask.
